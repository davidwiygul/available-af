# provision_scheduler PUBLIC_IP
# installs Airflow on given instance and enables and starts
#     the Airflow scheduler (not Heirflow multischeduler)
#     as a systemd service
# makes the same assumptions as efs and airflow scripts
# typically run soon after all queue nodes (1 or more)
#     and database nodes (1 or 2) have been provisioned,
#     if you prefer to use the classic Airflow scheduler (on a single node)
