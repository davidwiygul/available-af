This folders contains scripts and configuration files to install and configure
      various services on EC2 instances.
It is assumed that all instances are running Ubuntu 18.04 and that security
    group settings permit all necessary traffic between instances as well as
    SSH access from the computer running the scripts.

Most scripts require at least that AWS_SSH_KEY be set in
provision.config.

The scripts provide detailed documentation of the installation process
(and of course you should be reviewed and possibly adjusted before being run!), which should be straightforward to adapt to a different Linux distribution or
even cloud platform.
